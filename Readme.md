# Siren
*Siren*, is a tracker interface that embodies abstractions where programming is realized as the medium for pattern sequencing in a modular fashion. It is based on a hierarchical structure that consists of scenes and channels. Separate channels have independent patterns; a complete song consists of a master list of repeated patterns. In addition to pattern composition, *Siren* supports programming variations of and transitions between patterns. 


Supported programming languages : 
SuperCollider
Haskell/TidalCycles

**Note:** This is a beta release (*v0.5*), and it has not been tested comprehensively. If you come across a bug, please do [submit an `issue` ](https://github.com/inceio/inceio/issues/new), and/or create a `pull request` of you feel like participating in its development.

## Download
You can get *Siren* either by downloading repository `as a ZIP file` at [https://github.com/inceio/siren](github.com/inceio/siren), or by using the command line to `clone` the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/inceio/Siren.git
```

## Build and Run
#### Dependencies:
Make sure the latest versions of following software are installed for your system user
- [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/download.html)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
+ Make sure `npm` is globally installed with `NodeJS`
- [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/getting_started.html)

Then follow these lines to install package dependencies:
```shell
cd path/to/downloaded/repo
npm i
```


```
In order to bind software dependencies, edit full paths in config/config.json according to your file system formatting and save the file. Copy paste your startup files to scd-start-default.scd and tidal-boot-default.hs into config folder or set the appropriate paths in config.json

Note that it's possible to target required paths using the `Settings` module in the interface.
```



**Note:** Make sure SuperCollider is either idle or closed before moving on.

Now you can start the interface
```shell
npm start
```
and initialize the backend

```shell
npm run siren
```

then go to `http://localhost:3000/` or `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` in your browser
*Tested with Chrome on Windows 10 and MacOSX El Capitan*

## Modules

### Scenes

Scenes are the core of `Siren` and a scene serves as a framework to the composition. Each scene comprises of unique channels, global modifiers and patterns. 

*example in Figure (a)*- Textbox for scene name - `Update`/`Add` button- `Clear Matrix` button


### Sequencer (aka Matrix) 
#### Channels

Channels can be added using `Add Channel` layout and consists of `type`, `name`, `step` and `transition` parameters. Once a channel is added to the sequencer, the parameters and layout can be adjusted dynamically.  Each cell is a textbox allowing any type of text input. Patterns can be looked up from the dictionary with their names and parameters. When a cell is active, it triggers the pattern with appropriate name and applies parameters in an ordered fashion.  See `parameters` for various types.

You can add channels using next module:

### Add Channel
Please note that channels has to be defined appropriately in `tidal-boot-default.hs` or compiled using `console`.

**Transitions:** Transition functions for TidalCycles
*example in Figure (b)*- Transition function (i.e. `(clutchIn 4)`)
**Steps:** Initial step number of channel
**Type:** Channel type, possible types; SCSynth, MIDI, Visual

#### Cells
Cells of the channels serve as a canvas for pattern names and pattern parameters.

### Pattern Parameters

Siren allows patterns to be parameterized and can be called with different parameters from different cells in the channel. 

### Random Parameters
`|x,y|` returns a random value within the `x` and `y` 

## Patterns
Disclaimer: Please omit the channel number and dollar sign on Tidal commands (instead of `d1 $ sound "bd"` just write `sound "bd"`)

Tidal patterns are stored in the `dictionary` on the right hand side of the interface. This dictionary is unique for each scene and interacts with the sequencer in terms of parameters and calls.

#### Temporal parameter 
 `t`  represents the temporal parameter for each timer and it can be used in expressions to create complex values, especially with math expressions.

#### Mathematical expressions 
Mathematical expressions can be used in the patterns in the dictionary, parser evaluates the expressions when enclosed with `&` symbol.*example in Figure (c)*- Math expression enclosed by `& ... &` (i.e. in the body of `jvv`: ```... [~ f3 &`t`%3 &] ~ ...```)


#### Value Parameters
Any character sequence inside Siren pattern can be parameterized by surrounding desired spot with \` symbol (like surrounding a phrase for Markdown code block). Using this feature, you can not only pass well-tuned values dynamically, but also pass anything you want.

```haskell
n `x` # s `y` 
```
This can be called with any `x`or  `y` value such as (assume it's named as `sq`):
``` sq `"{3*4}%3"` `"bd"` ``` 
or
``` sq `"{3*4 4*2}%3"` `"bd"` ``` 

### Pattern History
This module stores the successfully compiled patterns to keep track of the running sequences.

### Console
This module serves as a CLI(Command-Line-Interface) to Haskell and SuperCollider 

### Global Modulators

This is an experimental module that can be toggled using right click menu. There are two sections dedicated to appending and prepending to the running code. `ctrl+enter` activates the code and sections can be recalled by creating presets. Pressing `Rec` button saves the active modifiers. `shift+ click` clears the desired slot and `alt+ click` overwrites it. These modifiers are applied to the patterns shown in the pattern history section. (i.e active patterns)Channels that you want to modify can also be specified using the `channel` section in the submenu. Writing `1 2` will make the modifiers only affect the first two channels, `0` is a special case and means that modifiers will be applied to all channels in the scene.

### Settings
In this module, itâ€™s possible to set various settings of Siren such as startup configs or various paths.

### Debug Console
This module serves as a debug console for GHC.
